# Hypothesis Testing
Welcome to the Hypothesis Testing repository! This project provides essential resources, tools, and tutorials for understanding and applying hypothesis testing techniques in various statistical contexts.

### Introduction
Hypothesis testing is a fundamental statistical method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating and testing hypotheses to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis. This repository offers a comprehensive guide to hypothesis testing, including practical examples and tools to perform and interpret tests effectively.

### Examples
This repository includes various examples to illustrate hypothesis testing techniques:

Basic Hypothesis Testing: Examples of one-sample and two-sample tests, including t-tests and z-tests.
Advanced Testing: Techniques for chi-square tests, ANOVA, and non-parametric tests.
P-Value Interpretation: Understanding and interpreting p-values and significance levels.
Case Studies: Real-world scenarios demonstrating the application of hypothesis testing in different fields.
